Essentially giving the reigns to an AI agent. We'll use a fun example to make these concepts clear.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Our Example Scenario: SweetBot AI\n</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine you're building <strong>SweetBot AI</strong>, a tech support chatbot for <strong>LolliPop Dreams</strong>, a company that sells custom-made lollipops in hundreds of flavors. The AI chatbot helps customers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create custom lollipop orders based on flavor preferences</li>\n<li>Track order status</li>\n<li>Update flavor combinations</li>\n<li>View their order history</li>\n<li>Cancel orders</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This scenario has unique requirements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Customers can combine multiple flavors (strawberry + vanilla swirl)</li>\n<li>Orders have statuses (pending, mixing, cooling, packaging, shipped)</li>\n<li>The AI needs to learn from customer preferences</li>\n<li>Flavor combinations must be validated (some flavors don't mix well!)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Table of Contents\n</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is CRUD?</li>\n<li>Understanding the Example Format</li>\n<li>Understanding the Basics</li>\n<li>The Request-Response Cycle</li>\n<li>Input Parsing: How Data Comes In</li>\n<li>CRUD Operations in Detail</li>\n<li>Output Formatting: How Data Goes Out</li>\n<li>Complete Example: Creating and Managing Orders</li>\n<li>Using AI to Build Endpoints</li>\n<li>Security Basics</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What is CRUD?\n</h2>\n\n<p>CRUD stands for the four basic operations you can perform on data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Create</strong>: Add new records to the database (e.g., create a new lollipop order)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Read</strong>: Retrieve existing records from the database (e.g., get order status)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Update</strong>: Modify existing records in the database (e.g., change flavor combination)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Delete</strong>: Remove records from the database (e.g., cancel an order)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Example Format\n</h2>\n\n<p>Throughout this document, you'll see examples labeled as <strong>Input Example</strong> and <strong>Output Example</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do these mean?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Input Example</strong>: Shows what data the <strong>frontend sends</strong> to the backend (the request)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Output Example</strong>: Shows what data the <strong>backend sends back</strong> to the frontend (the response)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Why this format?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you're building an endpoint, you need to know:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What format should the input be in? (Look at the Input Example)</li>\n<li>What format should the output be in? (Look at the Output Example)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Basics\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  What is an Endpoint?\n</h3>\n\n<p>An <strong>endpoint</strong> is like a specific address or phone number that your application can call to perform an action. Just like you might call a pizza place at a specific number to order pizza, your frontend calls specific endpoints to interact with your backend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>https://api.lollipopdreams.com/orders</code> - This is an endpoint for managing orders</li>\n<li>\n<code>https://api.lollipopdreams.com/customers</code> - This is an endpoint for managing customers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each endpoint does a specific job. The <code>/orders</code> endpoint handles everything related to orders.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  What are HTTP Methods? (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n</h3>\n\n<p>HTTP methods are like different types of requests you can make. Think of them as different actions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>GET</strong>: \"Hey, can I see that?\" (Reading data)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>POST</strong>: \"Hey, can you create this for me?\" (Creating new data)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>PUT</strong>: \"Hey, can you update this?\" (Modifying existing data)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>DELETE</strong>: \"Hey, can you remove this?\" (Deleting data)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>GET</strong> = Looking at a menu (you're just reading, not changing anything)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>POST</strong> = Placing an order (you're creating something new)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>PUT</strong> = Modifying your order (you're changing something that exists)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>DELETE</strong> = Canceling your order (you're removing something)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  How Endpoints and Methods Work Together\n</h3>\n\n<p>When you combine an endpoint with a method, you get a specific action:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>GET    /orders     → \"Show me all my orders\"\nGET    /orders/123 → \"Show me order number 123\"\nPOST   /orders     → \"Create a new order\"\nPUT    /orders/123 → \"Update order number 123\"\nDELETE /orders/123 → \"Cancel order number 123\"\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The number <code>123</code> in <code>/orders/123</code> is called a <strong>parameter</strong> - it's a way to specify which specific order you're talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Request-Response Cycle\n</h2>\n\n<p>Every time your frontend needs to do something with data, it follows this cycle:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>1. Frontend sends a request → 2. Backend processes it → 3. Backend sends a response → 4. Frontend receives response\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's break this down with our lollipop example:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Frontend sends a request</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alice wants to see her orders</li>\n<li>Frontend sends: \"GET /orders\" request to the backend</li>\n<li>Includes authentication (proves Alice is who she says she is)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Backend processes it</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Backend receives the request</li>\n<li>Checks: Is Alice authenticated? Yes ✓</li>\n<li>Queries database: \"Get all orders for Alice\"</li>\n<li>Formats the data nicely</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Backend sends a response</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Backend sends back Alice's orders in a structured format</li>\n<li>Includes status code (200 = success, 404 = not found, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: Frontend receives response</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Frontend gets the data</li>\n<li>Displays Alice's orders on the screen</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Input Parsing: How Data Comes In\n</h2>\n\n<p>When the frontend sends data to your backend, you need to <strong>parse</strong> it - which means reading it, understanding it, and converting it into a format your code can work with.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Request Bodies\n</h3>\n\n<p>When you create or update something, the frontend sends data in the <strong>request body</strong>. Think of it like filling out a form - you're sending information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Input Example: Creating a new order</strong></p>\n\n<p>Alice wants to create a custom lollipop order.

          "contentSnippet": "CRUD Operations: Architecture and Implementation Guide\n\n\nThis document explains how to build CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in an AI-powered web application backend. Essentially giving the reigns to an AI agent. We'll use a fun example to make these concepts clear.\nImagine you're building SweetBot AI, a tech support chatbot for LolliPop Dreams, a company that sells custom-made lollipops in hundreds of flavors. The AI chatbot helps customers:\nCreate custom lollipop orders based on flavor preferences\nTrack order status\nUpdate flavor combinations\nView their order history\nCancel orders\nThis scenario has unique requirements:\nCustomers can combine multiple flavors (strawberry + vanilla swirl)\nOrders have statuses (pending, mixing, cooling, packaging, shipped)\nThe AI needs to learn from customer preferences\nFlavor combinations must be validated (some flavors don't mix well!)\nWhat is CRUD?\nUnderstanding the Example Format\nUnderstanding the Basics\nThe Request-Response Cycle\nInput Parsing: How Data Comes In\nCRUD Operations in Detail\nOutput Formatting: How Data Goes Out\nComplete Example: Creating and Managing Orders\nUsing AI to Build Endpoints\nSecurity Basics\nCRUD stands for the four basic operations you can perform on data:\nCreate: Add new records to the database (e.g., create a new lollipop order)\nRead: Retrieve existing records from the database (e.g., get order status)\nUpdate: Modify existing records in the database (e.g., change flavor combination)\nDelete: Remove records from the database (e.g., cancel an order)\nThroughout this document, you'll see examples labeled as Input Example and Output Example.\nWhat do these mean?\nInput Example: Shows what data the frontend sends to the backend (the request)\nOutput Example: Shows what data the backend sends back to the frontend (the response)\nWhy this format?\nWhen you're building an endpoint, you need to know:\nWhat format should the input be in? (Look at the Input Example)\nWhat format should the output be in? (Look at the Output Example)\nAn endpoint is like a specific address or phone number that your application can call to perform an action. Just like you might call a pizza place at a specific number to order pizza, your frontend calls specific endpoints to interact with your backend.\nExample:\nhttps://api.lollipopdreams.com/orders - This is an endpoint for managing orders\nhttps://api.lollipopdreams.com/customers - This is an endpoint for managing customers\nEach endpoint does a specific job. The /orders endpoint handles everything related to orders.\nHTTP methods are like different types of requests you can make. Think of them as different actions:\nGET: \"Hey, can I see that?\" (Reading data)\nPOST: \"Hey, can you create this for me?\" (Creating new data)\nPUT: \"Hey, can you update this?\" (Modifying existing data)\nDELETE: \"Hey, can you remove this?\" (Deleting data)\nReal-world analogy:\nGET = Looking at a menu (you're just reading, not changing anything)\nPOST = Placing an order (you're creating something new)\nPUT = Modifying your order (you're changing something that exists)\nDELETE = Canceling your order (you're removing something)\nWhen you combine an endpoint with a method, you get a specific action:\nGET    /orders     → \"Show me all my orders\"\nGET    /orders/123 → \"Show me order number 123\"\nPOST   /orders     → \"Create a new order\"\nPUT    /orders/123 → \"Update order number 123\"\nDELETE /orders/123 → \"Cancel order number 123\"\n\nThe number 123 in /orders/123 is called a parameter - it's a way to specify which specific order you're talking about.\nEvery time your frontend needs to do something with data, it follows this cycle:\n1. Frontend sends a request → 2. Backend processes it → 3. Backend sends a response → 4. Frontend receives response\n\nLet's break this down with our lollipop example:\nStep 1: Frontend sends a request\nAlice wants to see her orders\nFrontend sends: \"GET /orders\" request to the backend\nIncludes authentication (proves Alice is who she says she is)\nStep 2: Backend processes it\nBackend receives the request\nChecks: Is Alice authenticated? Yes ✓\nQueries database: \"Get all orders for Alice\"\nFormats the data nicely\nStep 3: Backend sends a response\nBackend sends back Alice's orders in a structured format\nIncludes status code (200 = success, 404 = not found, etc.)\nStep 4: Frontend receives response\nFrontend gets the data\nDisplays Alice's orders on the screen\nWhen the frontend sends data to your backend, you need to parse it - which means reading it, understanding it, and converting it into a format your code can work with.\nWhen you create or update something, the frontend sends data in the request body. Think of it like filling out a form - you're sending information.\nInput Example: Creating a new order\nAlice wants to create a custom lollipop order. The frontend sends this data:\n{\n    \"customer_id\": 456,\n    \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\"],\n    \"size\": \"large\",\n    \"quantity\": 12,\n    \"special_instructions\": \"Extra sweet, please!\"\n}\n\nWhat the backend needs to do:\nParse the JSON (read and understand the structure)\nExtract each field (customer_id, flavor_combination, etc.)\nValidate that the data is correct:\n\n\nIs customer_id a number? ✓\nAre the flavors valid? ✓\nIs size one of: \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\"? ✓\nIs quantity a positive number? ✓\nSanitize special_instructions (remove any dangerous content)\nFor reading data (GET requests), information often comes in the URL as query parameters. These are the parts after the ? in a URL.\nInput Example: Getting filtered orders\nAlice wants to see only her pending orders. The frontend sends:\nGET /orders?customer_id=456&status=pending&page=1&limit=20\n\nBreaking this down:\n/orders = the endpoint\n? = starts the query parameters\ncustomer_id=456 = filter by customer ID 456\n& = separates parameters\nstatus=pending = only show pending orders\npage=1 = show page 1\nlimit=20 = show 20 orders per page\nWhat the backend needs to do:\nParse the query parameters\nExtract each parameter value\nUse these values to filter the database query\nSometimes the ID of what you want is in the URL path itself.\nInput Example: Getting a specific order\nAlice wants to see details of order #789:\nGET /orders/789\n\nBreaking this down:\n/orders = the endpoint\n/789 = the order ID (this is a URL parameter)\nWhat the backend needs to do:\nExtract the number 789 from the URL\nUse it to find that specific order in the database\nBefore you save data, you need to validate it - make sure it's correct and safe.\nInput Example: Invalid flavor combination\nSomeone tries to create an order with invalid flavors:\n{\n    \"flavor_combination\": [\"chocolate\", \"mint\", \"garlic\"]\n}\n\nValidation checks:\nDo all flavors exist? \"chocolate\" ✓, \"mint\" ✓, \"garlic\" ✗ (not a valid flavor)\nCan these flavors be combined? Chocolate + mint ✓, but garlic doesn't go with anything!\nOutput Example: Validation error response\n{\n    \"error\": \"Invalid flavor combination: 'garlic' is not a valid flavor. Please choose from our available flavors.\",\n    \"code\": \"VALIDATION_ERROR\"\n}\n\nSanitization means cleaning the data to remove dangerous content.\nInput Example: Dangerous input\nSomeone tries to include malicious code:\n{\n    \"special_instructions\": \"<script>alert('hack')</script>Extra sweet, please!\"\n}\n\nAfter sanitization:\n{\n    \"special_instructions\": \"Extra sweet, please!\"\n}\n\nThe dangerous script tag is removed, but the legitimate text remains.\nWhen working with AI services, you need to:\nFormat input - Convert your data into the format the AI expects\nSend to AI - Make the API call\nParse response - Extract and structure the data from the AI's response (which comes as function calls)\nSave to database - Store the parsed data\nBefore sending data to an AI service, you need to format it in a specific way. Here's how:\nExample: Formatting Input\nYou have this data from the frontend:\n{\n    \"customer_id\": 456,\n    \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\"],\n    \"size\": \"large\",\n    \"quantity\": 12,\n    \"special_instructions\": \"Extra sweet, please!\"\n}\n\nFormat it for the AI service like this:\n// Define a function to format order data for the AI service\nfunction formatOrderForAI(orderData, customerInfo) {\n    // Create an empty string to build the formatted prompt\n    let formattedPrompt = \"\";\n\n    // Add the customer ID to the prompt with a label\n    formattedPrompt += `customer-id: ${orderData.customer_id}\\n`;\n    // Add the customer name to the prompt with a label\n    formattedPrompt += `customer-name: ${customerInfo.name}\\n`;\n\n    // Join the flavor array into a comma-separated string and add to prompt\n    formattedPrompt += `flavor-combination: ${orderData.flavor_combination.join(\", \")}\\n`;\n\n    // Add the size to the prompt with a label\n    formattedPrompt += `size: ${orderData.size}\\n`;\n    // Add the quantity to the prompt with a label\n    formattedPrompt += `quantity: ${orderData.quantity}\\n`;\n\n    // Check if special instructions were provided\n    if (orderData.special_instructions) {\n        // Add the special instructions to the prompt with quotes around the text\n        formattedPrompt += `special-instructions: \"${orderData.special_instructions}\"\\n`;\n    }\n\n    // Return the complete formatted prompt string\n    return formattedPrompt;\n}\n\nThe formatted input would be:\ncustomer-id: 456\ncustomer-name: Alice Sweettooth\nflavor-combination: strawberry, vanilla_swirl\nsize: large\nquantity: 12\nspecial-instructions: \"Extra sweet, please!\"\n\nThe AI responds with function calls, not JSON. You need to parse these function calls to extract the data.\nExample: AI Response\nThe AI service returns this:\nflavors(\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\", \"caramel\")\nprice(24.99)\nstatus(\"pending\")\nproduction-time(\"2 days\")\nspecial-notes(\"Customer requested extra sweet - will add extra sugar\")\n\nExample: Parsing the Response\n// Define a function to parse the AI response that contains function calls\nfunction parseAIResponse(aiResponse) {\n    // Split the response text into an array of lines using newline character\n    const lines = aiResponse.split('\\n');\n\n    // Create an object to store the parsed data with default values\n    const parsed = {\n        flavors: [],        // Array to hold flavor names\n        price: 0,           // Number to hold the price\n        status: \"\",         // String to hold the status\n        production_time: \"\", // String to hold production time\n        special_notes: \"\"   // String to hold special notes\n    };\n\n    // Loop through each line in the response\n    for (let line of lines) {\n        // Remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the line\n        line = line.trim();\n\n        // Skip to the next line if this line is empty\n        if (!line) continue;\n\n        // Check if this line starts with the flavors function call\n        if (line.startsWith('flavors(')) {\n            // Use regex to extract everything between the parentheses\n            const match = line.match(/flavors\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\n            // Check if a match was found\n            if (match) {\n                // Get the content inside the parentheses (the arguments)\n                const flavorString = match[1];\n                // Split by comma, trim each item, and remove quotes from each flavor name\n                parsed.flavors = flavorString.split(',').map(f => f.trim().replace(/^\"|\"$/g, ''));\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Check if this line starts with the price function call\n        if (line.startsWith('price(')) {\n            // Use regex to extract the number between the parentheses\n            const match = line.match(/price\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\n            // Check if a match was found\n            if (match) {\n                // Convert the string number to an actual number and store it\n                parsed.price = parseFloat(match[1]);\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Check if this line starts with the status function call\n        if (line.startsWith('status(')) {\n            // Use regex to extract the status value between the parentheses\n            const match = line.match(/status\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\n            // Check if a match was found\n            if (match) {\n                // Remove quotes from the status value and store it\n                parsed.status = match[1].replace(/^\"|\"$/g, '');\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Check if this line starts with the production-time function call\n        if (line.startsWith('production-time(')) {\n            // Use regex to extract the time value between the parentheses\n            const match = line.match(/production-time\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\n            // Check if a match was found\n            if (match) {\n                // Remove quotes from the time value and store it\n                parsed.production_time = match[1].replace(/^\"|\"$/g, '');\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Check if this line starts with the special-notes function call\n        if (line.startsWith('special-notes(')) {\n            // Use regex to extract the notes text between the parentheses\n            const match = line.match(/special-notes\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\n            // Check if a match was found\n            if (match) {\n                // Remove quotes from the notes text and store it\n                parsed.special_notes = match[1].replace(/^\"|\"$/g, '');\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Return the parsed object with all extracted data\n    return parsed;\n}\n\nThe parsed output would be:\n{\n    \"flavors\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\", \"caramel\"],\n    \"price\": 24.99,\n    \"status\": \"pending\",\n    \"production_time\": \"2 days\",\n    \"special_notes\": \"Customer requested extra sweet - will add extra sugar\"\n}\n\nExample: Multiple Function Calls\nThe AI might return multiple function calls on separate lines:\nflavors(\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\")\nprice(24.99)\nstatus(\"pending\")\nflavors(\"chocolate\", \"mint\")\nprice(19.99)\nstatus(\"pending\")\n\nExample: Parsing Multiple Function Calls\n// Define a function to parse multiple function calls from AI response\nfunction parseMultipleFunctionCalls(aiResponse) {\n    // Create an array to store all parsed results\n    const results = [];\n    // Create an object to hold the current result being built\n    let currentResult = {\n        flavors: [],  // Array for flavor names\n        price: 0,     // Number for price\n        status: \"\"    // String for status\n    };\n\n    // Split the response into an array of lines\n    const lines = aiResponse.split('\\n');\n\n    // Loop through each line in the response\n    for (let line of lines) {\n        // Remove whitespace from the beginning and end\n        line = line.trim();\n        // Skip empty lines\n        if (!line) continue;\n\n        // Check if this line is a flavors function call\n        if (line.startsWith('flavors(')) {\n            // Check if we already have data in currentResult (means we're starting a new item)\n            if (currentResult.flavors.length > 0 || currentResult.price > 0) {\n                // Save the previous result to the results array (copy it, don't reference it)\n                results.push({...currentResult});\n                // Reset currentResult to empty for the new item\n                currentResult = { flavors: [], price: 0, status: \"\" };\n            }\n\n            // Extract the flavors from between the parentheses\n            const match = line.match(/flavors\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\n            // Check if a match was found\n            if (match) {\n                // Get the string of flavors inside the parentheses\n

      // Extract the price number from between the parentheses\n            const match = line.match(/price\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\n            // Check if a match was found\n            if (match) {\n                // Convert the string to a number and store in currentResult\n                currentResult.price = parseFloat(match[1]);\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Check if this line is a status function call\n        if (line.startsWith('status(')) {\n            // Extract the status value from between the parentheses\n            const match = line.match(/status\\(([^)]+)\\)/);\n            // Check if a match was found\n            if (match) {\n                // Remove quotes and store the status in currentResult\n                currentResult.status =

 results.push({...currentResult});\n                // Reset currentResult for the next item\n                currentResult = { flavors: [], price: 0, status: \"\" };\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if there's an incomplete result left (didn't end with status)\n    if (currentResult.flavors.length > 0 || currentResult.price > 0) {\n        // Save the incomplete result to the results array\n        results.push(currentResult);\n    }\n\n    // Return the array of all parsed results\n    return results;\n}\n\nThe parsed output would be:\n[\n    {\n        \"flavors\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\"],\n        \"price\": 24.99,\n        \"status\": \"pending\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"flavors\": [\"chocolate\", \"mint\"],\n        \"price\": 19.99,\n        \"status\": \"pending\"\n    }\n]\n\nHere's how it all works together:\nExample: Complete Flow\n// Define an async function to create an order using AI (async means it can wait for operations)\nasync function createOrderWithAI(orderData, customerInfo) {\n    // Step 1: Call the formatting function to convert JSON data into prompt format\n    const formattedInput = formatOrderForAI(orderData, customerInfo);\n\n    // Step 2: Send the formatted input to the AI service and wait for response (await pauses until done)\n    const aiResponse = await sendToAIService(formattedInput);\n\n    // Step 3: Parse the AI response to extract structured data from function calls\n    const parsedResponse = parseAIResponse(aiResponse);\n\n    // Step 4: Create an order object using the original data and parsed AI response\n    const order = {\n        customer_id: orderData.customer_id,              // Use customer ID from original request\n        flavor_combination: parsedResponse.flavors,      // Use flavors from parsed AI response\n        size: orderData.size,                            // Use size from original request\n        quantity: orderData.quantity,                    // Use quantity from original request\n        status: parsedResponse.status,                    // Use status from parsed AI response\n        price: parsedResponse.price,                     // Use price from parsed AI response\n        special_instructions: parsedResponse.special_notes, // Use notes from parsed AI response\n        created_at: new Date()                           // Set current date/time as creation timestamp\n    };\n\n    // Step 5: Save the order object to the database and wait for it to complete\n    const savedOrder = await database.save(order);\n\n    // Step 6: Return a formatted response object to send back to the frontend\n    return {\n        message: \"Order created successfully\",  // Success message for the user\n        order: savedOrder                       // The saved order data with database ID\n    };\n}\n\nPattern 1: Single argument function\nflavors(\"strawberry\", \"vanilla\")\nprice(24.99)\nstatus(\"pending\")\n\nPattern 2: Multiple arguments\nflavors(\"strawberry\", \"vanilla\", \"caramel\")\n\nPattern 3: Quoted strings\nstatus(\"pending\")\nspecial-notes(\"Customer requested extra sweet\")\n\nPattern 4: Numbers (no quotes)\nprice(24.99)\nquantity(12)\n\nWhen parsing function calls, always:\nUse regex to extract content between parentheses: functionName\\(([^)]+)\\)\n\nSplit multiple arguments by comma\nRemove quotes from string arguments\nConvert number strings to actual numbers\nHandle empty lines\nTrim whitespace\nWhat it does: Creates a new record in the database.\nExample: Creating a new lollipop order\nInput Example: Create order request\nPOST /orders\n{\n    \"customer_id\": 456,\n    \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\"],\n    \"size\": \"large\",\n    \"quantity\": 12,\n    \"special_instructions\": \"Extra sweet, please!\"\n}\n\nWhat happens on the backend:\nAuthenticate: Verify the customer is who they say they are\nParse: Read the JSON data\nValidate: \n\n\nCheck flavors exist and are compatible\nCheck size is valid (\"small\", \"medium\", or \"large\")\nCheck quantity is between 1 and 100\nSanitize: Clean special_instructions\nCalculate: Determine price based on size and quantity\nCreate: Save the order to database with status \"pending\"\nReturn: Send back the created order\nOutput Example: Create order response\n{\n    \"message\": \"Order created successfully\",\n    \"order\": {\n        \"id\": 789,\n        \"customer_id\": 456,\n        \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\"],\n        \"size\": \"large\",\n        \"quantity\": 12,\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"price\": 24.99,\n        \"special_instructions\": \"Extra sweet, please!\",\n        \"created_at\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\"\n    }\n}\n\nKey points:\nThe backend assigns an ID (789) automatically\nThe backend sets default values (status: \"pending\")\nThe backend calculates derived values (price: 24.99)\nThere are two types of read operations:\nWhat it does: Gets one specific record.\nInput Example: Get single order\nGET /orders/789\n\nWhat happens on the backend:\nExtract order ID: 789\nAuthenticate: Verify the customer\nAuthorize: Check if this order belongs to this customer\nQuery: Find order #789 in database\nReturn: Send back the order details\nOutput Example: Get single order response\n{\n    \"order\": {\n        \"id\": 789,\n        \"customer_id\": 456,\n        \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\"],\n        \"size\": \"large\",\n        \"quantity\": 12,\n        \"status\": \"mixing\",\n        \"price\": 24.99,\n        \"special_instructions\": \"Extra sweet, please!\",\n        \"created_at\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n        \"updated_at\": \"2024-01-15T11:00:00Z\"\n    }\n}\n\nWhat it does: Gets multiple records, often with filtering and pagination.\nInput Example: Get list of orders\nGET /orders?customer_id=456&status=pending&page=1&limit=20\n\nWhat happens on the backend:\nParse query parameters:\n\n\ncustomer_id: 456\nstatus: \"pending\"\npage: 1\nlimit: 20\nAuthenticate: Verify the customer\nBuild query: Find orders WHERE customer_id = 456 AND status = \"pending\"\nCount total: How many orders match? (e.g., 3 orders)\nApply pagination: Skip 0, take 20 (for page 1)\nOrder: Sort by newest first\nReturn: Send back the list with pagination info\nOutput Example: Get list of orders response\n{\n    \"orders\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": 789,\n            \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\"],\n            \"size\": \"large\",\n            \"quantity\": 12,\n            \"status\": \"pending\",\n            \"price\": 24.99,\n            \"created_at\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 788,\n            \"flavor_combination\": [\"chocolate\", \"mint\"],\n            \"size\": \"medium\",\n            \"quantity\": 6,\n            \"status\": \"pending\",\n            \"price\": 12.99,\n            \"created_at\": \"2024-01-14T15:20:00Z\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"pagination\": {\n        \"page\": 1,\n        \"limit\": 20,\n        \"total\": 3,\n        \"total_pages\": 1\n    }\n}\n\nKey points:\nPagination helps when there are many results\nFilters let users see only what they want\nTotal count helps the frontend show \"Page 1 of 3\" etc.\nWhat it does: Changes an existing record.\nInput Example: Update order\nPUT /orders/789\n{\n    \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\", \"caramel\"],\n    \"quantity\": 24\n}\n\nWhat happens on the backend:\nExtract order ID: 789\nAuthenticate: Verify the customer\nAuthorize: Check if order #789 belongs to this customer\nCheck rules: Can this order be updated? (Maybe only \"pending\" orders can be changed)\nParse update data\nValidate: Check new flavor combination is valid\nUpdate: Change only the provided fields\nRecalculate: Update price based on new quantity\nReturn: Send back the updated order\nOutput Example: Update order response\n{\n    \"message\": \"Order updated successfully\",\n    \"order\": {\n        \"id\": 789,\n        \"customer_id\": 456,\n        \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\", \"caramel\"],\n        \"size\": \"large\",\n        \"quantity\": 24,\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"price\": 49.98,\n        \"updated_at\": \"2024-01-15T11:30:00Z\"\n    }\n}\n\nKey points:\nOnly the fields provided are updated (partial update)\nOther fields stay the same\nDerived values (like price) are recalculated\nWhat it does: Removes a record (or marks it as deleted).\nInput Example: Cancel order\nDELETE /orders/789\n\nWhat happens on the backend:\nExtract order ID: 789\nAuthenticate: Verify the customer\nAuthorize: Check if order #789 belongs to this customer\nCheck rules: Can this order be canceled? (Maybe \"shipped\" orders can't be canceled)\nDelete: Remove from database OR mark as \"canceled\" (soft delete)\nHandle side effects: Process refund if needed\nReturn: Send confirmation\nOutput Example: Delete order response\n{\n    \"message\": \"Order canceled successfully\",\n    \"order_id\": 789,\n    \"refund_amount\": 24.99,\n    \"refund_processed\": true\n}\n\nKey points:\nAlways verify ownership before deleting\nCheck business rules (when can things be deleted?)\nHandle related actions (refunds, notifications, etc.)\nAfter processing a request, the backend needs to send a response back to the frontend. This response should be consistent and well-structured.\nAll responses should follow the same format so the frontend knows what to expect.\nSuccess Response Format:\n{\n    \"message\": \"Operation completed successfully\",\n    \"data\": { /* the actual data */ },\n    \"pagination\": { /* if it's a list */ }\n}\n\nError Response Format:\n{\n    \"error\": \"Human-readable error message\",\n    \"code\": \"ERROR_CODE\"\n}\n\nStatus codes tell the frontend if the request succeeded or failed:\n200 OK: Everything worked! (for GET, PUT, DELETE)\n201 Created: Successfully created something new (for POST)\n400 Bad Request: The data you sent is invalid\n401 Unauthorized: You're not logged in\n403 Forbidden: You're logged in, but you don't have permission\n404 Not Found: The thing you're looking for doesn't exist\n500 Internal Server Error: Something went wrong on the server\nOutput Example: Success response\n{\n    \"message\": \"Order created successfully\",\n    \"order\": {\n        \"id\": 789,\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"price\": 24.99\n    }\n}\n\nStatus code: 201 Created\nOutput Example: Error response\n{\n    \"error\": \"Order not found\",\n    \"code\": \"NOT_FOUND\"\n}\n\nStatus code: 404 Not Found\nSometimes you need to include related information in your response.\nOutput Example: Order with customer details\n{\n    \"order\": {\n        \"id\": 789,\n        \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\"],\n        \"status\": \"mixing\",\n        \"price\": 24.99\n    },\n    \"customer\": {\n        \"id\": 456,\n        \"name\": \"Alice Sweettooth\",\n        \"loyalty_points\": 1250\n    },\n    \"flavor_details\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"strawberry\",\n            \"description\": \"Sweet and fruity\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"vanilla_swirl\",\n            \"description\": \"Creamy vanilla\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nThis gives the frontend all the information it needs in one response, so it doesn't have to make multiple requests.\nLet's walk through a complete scenario where Alice creates and manages her lollipop orders.\nInput Example: Create order\nPOST /orders\nHeaders: {\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer abc123token\"\n}\nBody: {\n    \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\", \"vanilla_swirl\"],\n    \"size\": \"large\",\n    \"quantity\": 12,\n    \"special_instructions\": \"Extra sweet, please!\"\n}\n\nBackend processing:\nExtract customer from token (Alice, customer_id: 456)\nParse the JSON body\nValidate flavors, size, quantity\nSanitize special_instructions\nCalculate price: $24.99\nCreate order in database\nReturn created order\nOutput Example: Create order response\n{\n    \"message\": \"Order created successfully\",\n    \"order\": {\n        \"id\": 789,\n        \"customer_id\": 456,\n        \"flavor_combination\": [\"strawberry\",

Backend parses AI response → \n7. Backend saves to database → \n8. Backend formats response → \n9. Backend returns response to frontend\n\nMake sure your AI prompt covers all these steps!\nSecurity is critical for any application. Here are the essential concepts.\nAuthentication answers: \"Who are you?\" It verifies that a user is who they claim to be.\nHow it works:\nUser logs in with email and password\nBackend verifies the credentials\nBackend creates a token (like a temporary ID card)\nBackend sends token to frontend\nFrontend includes token in all future requests\nBackend validates token to identify the user\nInput Example: Login request\nPOST /login\n{\n    \"email\": \"alice@example.com\",\n    \"password\": \"securepassword123\"\n}\n\nOutput Example: Login response\n{\n    \"token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\",\n    \"expires_in\": 3600,\n    \"customer_id\": 456\n}\n\nSubsequent requests include the token:\nInput Example: Authenticated request\nGET /orders\nHeaders: {\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\"\n}\n\nThe backend extracts the token, validates it, and knows this is Alice (customer_id: 456).\nKey principles:\nNever store passwords in plain text (always hash them)\nTokens should expire after a reasonable time\nAlways use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit\nAuthorization answers: \"What are you allowed to do?\" It determines what resources a user can access.\nExample: Order ownership check\nAlice tries to view order #789:\nInput Example: Authorized request\nGET /orders/789\nHeaders: {\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer alice_token\"\n}\n\nBackend checks:\nIs this a valid token? → Yes, it's Alice (customer_id: 456)\nDoes order 789 belong to customer 456? → Yes ✓\nReturn order data\nIf Bob tries to access Alice's order:\nInput Example: Unauthorized request\nGET /orders/789\nHeaders: {\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer bob_token\"\n}\n\nBackend checks:\nIs this a valid token? → Yes, it's Bob (customer_id: 789)\nDoes order 789 belong to customer 789? → No!\nReturn 403 Forbidden\nOutput Example: Authorization error\n{\n    \"error\": \"Access denied. This order does not belong to you.\",\n    \"code\": \"FORBIDDEN\"\n}\n\nWhy this matters:\nFrontend code is visible to anyone\nAPI keys in frontend can be stolen\nStolen keys can be used to make unauthorized requests\nBad approach (DON'T DO THIS):\n// ❌ NEVER DO THIS - Anyone can see this!\nconst API_KEY = \"sk_live_1234567890abcdef\";\n\nGood approach:\nFrontend calls YOUR backend\nYOUR backend calls external services with the API key\nAPI key stays on the server, never exposed\nInput Example: Frontend to backend\nPOST /api/generate-lollipop-suggestion\n{\n    \"preferences\": \"sweet\"\n}\n\nThe frontend doesn't know about any external API keys. Your backend handles that securely.\nKey principle:\nStore secrets (API keys, passwords) in environment variables on the server\nNever commit secrets to version control\nNever send secrets to the frontend\nWhat is rate limiting?\nWhy it matters:\nPrevents API abuse\nProtects against attacks\nEnsures fair resource usage\nControls costs\nExample:\nWithout rate limiting:\nAll 100 orders are processed\nServer is overwhelmed\nCosts skyrocket\nWith rate limiting:\nFirst 10 requests succeed\nRemaining 90 requests return error\nServer stays healthy\nOutput Example: Rate limit error\n{\n    \"error\": \"Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before making another request.\",\n    \"code\": \"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED\",\n    \"retry_after\": 60\n}\n\nCommon limits:\nFree tier: 10 requests per hour\nPremium tier: 1000 requests per hour\nWhy validate input?\nPrevents malicious data from entering your system\nEnsures data integrity\nProtects against attacks\nValidation checks:\nType: Is quantity actually a number?\nRange: Is quantity between 1 and 100?\nFormat: Are flavors from the approved list?\nSanitization: Remove dangerous HTML/scripts\nInput Example: Invalid input\n{\n    \"quantity\": \"not a number\"\n}\n\nOutput Example: Validation error\n{\n    \"error\": \"Invalid input: 'quantity' must be a number\",\n    \"code\": \"VALIDATION_ERROR\"\n}\n\nInput Example: Dangerous input\n{\n    \"special_instructions\": \"<script>alert('hack')</script>Extra sweet!\"\n}\n\nAfter sanitization:\n{\n    \"special_instructions\": \"Extra sweet!\"\n}\n\nThe dangerous script is removed.\nAlways use HTTPS in production:\nEncrypts data in transit\nPrevents man-in-the-middle attacks\nRequired for sensitive data (passwords, payment info)\nWhat HTTPS does:\nEncrypts data between client and server\nVerifies server identity\nProtects against eavesdropping\nAlways authenticate and authorize before processing requests\nValidate and sanitize all input data\nUse consistent response formats for success and error cases\nInclude ownership checks in all database queries\nHandle errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes\nProvide pagination for list endpoints\nStructure responses for easy frontend consumption\nCreate:\nParse input → Validate → Create in database → Return created record\nRead:\nParse parameters → Authenticate → Query database → Return results\nUpdate:\nParse input → Verify ownership → Validate → Update database → Return updated record\nDelete:\nVerify ownership → Check rules → Delete from database → Return confirmation\n✅ Implement authentication (verify who the user is)\n✅ Implement authorization (verify what they can access)\n✅ Never expose API keys on the frontend\n✅ Use environment variables for secrets\n✅ Implement rate limiting\n✅ Validate and sanitize all input\n✅ Use HTTPS in production\n✅ Don't expose sensitive information in error messages\nThis guide provides a foundation for building robust, secure CRUD operations. Remember: security is not optional—it's essential for protecting your users and your application.",

At the LINE DEVELOPER DAY 2018 held in Tokyo, Japan last year, LINE's CTO, Park Euibin, defined \"Next LINE\" as the development vision of LINE in technology. Among them, the related technologies in the three major areas of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and fintech will play a pivotal role, and with two keywords \"Connect\" and \"Mutually Beneficial Ecosystem\", it points out the concrete value brought by realizing \"Next LINE\", allowing LINE's services to continue to evolve.</p>\n\n<p>In order to explore more possibilities of AI and provide a platform for the AI development community to exchange ideas, LINE will jointly host a cross-national hackathon with NAVER, South Korea's number one search engine, themed on artificial intelligence, \"AI RUSH 2019\". \"AI RUSH 2019\" official website: <a href=\"https://ai-rush.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://ai-rush.com/</a></p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  Event Process:\n</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5fo1ky5y614w7c2ht0j1.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5fo1ky5y614w7c2ht0j1.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"329\"></a></p>\n\n<p>(Image from the AI-Rush official website)</p>\n\n<p>The entire <a href=\"https://ai-rush.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI-Rush</a> event is divided into two parts, the online preliminary round and the offline finals. First, the online preliminary round topic was \"Image Classification\". Participants had to submit the first stage solution before 08/13. Finally, after selection, the final teams went to NAVER Connect One in Chuncheon, South Korea for the final.</p>\n\n<p>After the fierce competition in the first stage, a total of thirty teams were selected through the first stage score calculation. They will go to South Korea to participate in the finals. I am very happy that four teams from Taiwan entered the finals, and I accompanied them all the way from Incheon Airport in South Korea to the venue of the finals.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  NAVER Connect One Finals:\n</h1>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  08/26 All members arrived\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8jd79u2dupw4cu60wg3j.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8jd79u2dupw4cu60wg3j.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fri6wfzf1qw0sziet01w1.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fri6wfzf1qw0sziet01w1.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1067\"></a></p>\n\n<p>On 08/26, after welcoming the four representative teams from Taiwan at Incheon Airport, we drove directly to the finals venue of NAVER Connect One in Chuncheon, northern South Korea. It was already evening when we arrived on the first day. After a short rest, we went to the restaurant for dinner.</p>\n\n<p>The restaurant at NAVER Connect One is actually quite clean, and there are dedicated staff to take care of all the meals for the participants. The food here made the competition partners feel very safe and satisfied. After dinner, many teams went back to their rooms to discuss the work allocation and related preparations for the next two days. You can see that every participating partner is eager to try.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj0mvuwf1r4b77i2lczj1.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj0mvuwf1r4b77i2lczj1.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Of course, the special stickers for the event and LINE Developer stickers are also indispensable. There are plenty of stickers around the venue for participants to use freely. Of course, there are also many special \"AI RUSH 2019\" stickers for this event.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  08/27 Officially started\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj9ybmlm9w0i3leck5js6.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj9ybmlm9w0i3leck5js6.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnzr6szzcow3ay9bz2nai.JPG\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnzr6szzcow3ay9bz2nai.JPG\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fab7ysw2jqv122glkk9m4.jpeg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fab7ysw2jqv122glkk9m4.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p>“AI is the new black” is the Slogan of this competition and is also taken from <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603748/ai-is-the-new-black/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MIT Technology Review 2017 article</a>. Which means that AI is the most exciting and the most up-to-date in this era. This is also what AI-Rush wants everyone who participates to feel.</p>\n\n<p>This venue is the place for the main AI-Rush final Hacking this time. It's great to discuss in this well-lit and comfortable venue, and there are also endless supplies of desserts, drinks and instant noodles outside, allowing every participating partner to concentrate on discussing and thinking about how to find the most suitable calculation method. Even at night or in the middle of the night, you can go to this venue to find food and discuss with the participants. On the first night, I heard that many team partners wanted to have a midnight snack, so they went to the venue to Hacking with everyone. In addition to finding inspiration, you can also get to know many participating partners.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Quiz Game\n</h2>\n\n<p>During the two-day and one-night Hacking process, every participating team was very tense, and everyone was facing the computer screen very seriously. In order to allow every participating partner to participate in discussions and interactions in addition to Hacking. The organizers arranged quizzes (Quiz time) at 10:00, 14:00, 16:00, 20:00 and 22:00, and the winners of each Quiz had the opportunity to get very valuable related gifts. Such quizzes can not only allow each participating team to relax a little, but also attract more participants to interact with other teams at the venue. Making the whole event very lively and interesting.</p>\n\n<p>The quiz forms are divided into the following types:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Quiz: Small challenges\n</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foni1kv4mbw4601brwo7m.JPG\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foni1kv4mbw4601brwo7m.JPG\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p>\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" is a very interesting interactive game, and it is also a way for the hard-working participants in the audience to stretch their bodies. By the host raising their hand to play the game of guessing, you must win the host (if it's a tie, it's also considered eliminated) to advance. Only the last few people have the opportunity to come to the front to receive related gifts.</p>\n\n<p>There are also other interesting small challenges:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Find the different points in two pictures.</li>\n<li>Guess whose photo is in the picture.</li>\n<li>Some small history about LINE.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The design of these small activities, in addition to allowing the participating partners at the venue to have relevant interactions, also relieves the tension generated by the competition. Allowing each participant to face the problem more seriously.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Treasure hunting\n</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8lnqa6e5c8eddolvnb41.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8lnqa6e5c8eddolvnb41.jpg\" alt=\"img\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\"></a> <a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5w1ba1944q4e6a5ondzo.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5w1ba1944q4e6a5ondzo.jpg\" alt=\"img\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In addition to the interesting quizzes, there are also treasure hunts. The organizers have hidden some small notes around the event venue and the restaurant. As long as you can find these small notes, you can also exchange for related gifts with the organizers at the end of each day. So you can see many participating teams, in addition to Hacking at the venue, you can also see them constantly searching for related \"treasures\" around the venue and the restaurant, the scene is very interesting.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Gifts\n</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnnfjtopceqnla3tbzn8s.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnnfjtopceqnla3tbzn8s.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In order to allow the participants to enjoy the interactive Quiz and Treasure Hunting more, the organizers have prepared a lot of gifts. I believe that every participant should have gained a lot.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  08/28 Announcement of rankings and awards\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu7t9gdbxz94nw30ft50l.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu7t9gdbxz94nw30ft50l.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p>There is always a day to announce the results of the fierce competition. Finally, congratulations to the team from Japan for winning the first prize. The second prize went to the students from the University of Tokyo, and the third prize went to the students from South Korea. These three teams are also happy to share, and they also shared on stage how to analyze the data, and shared the techniques to get high scores by understanding the data.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  08/29 Relaxing trip\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe1ljchk2rh5yc11j8rnk.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe1ljchk2rh5yc11j8rnk.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p>On the last day, a relaxing itinerary was arranged for all the participants. The staff arranged a Korean rail bike tour. The whole trip has a relaxing itinerary of nearly two hours. In addition to watching the beautiful railway scenery, there are also some tunnels with unique feelings. Every participant also relaxed and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of Korea.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzwt53he24nw0wpbmc7g0.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzwt53he24nw0wpbmc7g0.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Lunch was chosen with the famous Chuncheon chicken, and enjoyed the Korean Chuncheon flavored dishes in a flavorful Korean restaurant. Every participant told me that in the three-day itinerary, in addition to writing code Hacking, it was probably constantly eating. Whether it was the delicacies of NAVER Connect One, the snacks, or even the Chuncheon chicken on the last day. Every participant felt the organizers' intentions and the delicious food of Korea.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  Event Summary\n</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxo3z5s32exvnbsb55kr6.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxo3z5s32exvnbsb55kr6.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The event, which lasted for a whole month, finally selected thirty final teams from all over the world. The three-day intensive finals not only felt the enthusiasm of each participating team, but also felt everyone's focus and uncompromising pursuit of the best data model. Every team hopes that they can still come up with a better data model to solve the user's problems at the last moment, to seek the true meaning behind the data. I think this is also what AI-Rush wants every participant to get, and I look forward to the opportunity to meet every participating team again next time.</p>\n\n<p>Join the \"LINE Developer Official Community\" official account now, and you can receive push notifications of first-hand Meetup events, or the latest news related to the developer program. ▼</p>\n\n<p>\"LINE Developer Official Community\" official account ID: @line_tw_dev</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  About the \"LINE Developer Community Program\"\n</h1>\n\n<p>LINE launched the \"LINE Developer Community Program\" in Taiwan at the beginning of this year, and will long-term invest manpower and resources to hold developer community gatherings, job fairs, developer conferences, etc., both internally and externally, online and offline, in Taiwan, and is expected to hold more than 30 events throughout the year.

          "contentSnippet": "Hello everyone, I am Evan Lin, a Technical Evangelist at LINE Taiwan. At the LINE DEVELOPER DAY 2018 held in Tokyo, Japan last year, LINE's CTO, Park Euibin, defined \"Next LINE\" as the development vision of LINE in technology. Among them, the related technologies in the three major areas of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and fintech will play a pivotal role, and with two keywords \"Connect\" and \"Mutually Beneficial Ecosystem\", it points out the concrete value brought by realizing \"Next LINE\", allowing LINE's services to continue to evolve.\nIn order to explore more possibilities of AI and provide a platform for the AI development community to exchange ideas, LINE will jointly host a cross-national hackathon with NAVER, South Korea's number one search engine, themed on artificial intelligence, \"AI RUSH 2019\". \"AI RUSH 2019\" official website: https://ai-rush.com/\n\n(Image from the AI-Rush official website)\nThe entire AI-Rush event is divided into two parts, the online preliminary round and the offline finals. First, the online preliminary round topic was \"Image Classification\". Participants had to submit the first stage solution before 08/13. Finally, after selection, the final teams went to NAVER Connect One in Chuncheon, South Korea for the final.\nAfter the fierce competition in the first stage, a total of thirty teams were selected through the first stage score calculation. They will go to South Korea to participate in the finals. I am very happy that four teams from Taiwan entered the finals, and I accompanied them all the way from Incheon Airport in South Korea to the venue of the finals.\n\n\nOn 08/26, after welcoming the four representative teams from Taiwan at Incheon Airport, we drove directly to the finals venue of NAVER Connect One in Chuncheon, northern South Korea. It was already evening when we arrived on the first day. After a short rest, we went to the restaurant for dinner.\nThe restaurant at NAVER Connect One is actually quite clean, and there are dedicated staff to take care of all the meals for the participants. The food here made the competition partners feel very safe and satisfied. After dinner, many teams went back to their rooms to discuss the work allocation and related preparations for the next two days. You can see that every participating partner is eager to try.\n\nOf course, the special stickers for the event and LINE Developer stickers are also indispensable. There are plenty of stickers around the venue for participants to use freely. Of course, there are also many special \"AI RUSH 2019\" stickers for this event.\n\n\n\n“AI is the new black” is the Slogan of this competition and is also taken from MIT Technology Review 2017 article. Which means that AI is the most exciting and the most up-to-date in this era. This is also what AI-Rush wants everyone who participates to feel.\nThis venue is the place for the main AI-Rush final Hacking this time. It's great to discuss in this well-lit and comfortable venue, and there are also endless supplies of desserts, drinks and instant noodles outside, allowing every participating partner to concentrate on discussing and thinking about how to find the most suitable calculation method. Even at night or in the middle of the night, you can go to this venue to find food and discuss with the participants. On the first night, I heard that many team partners wanted to have a midnight snack, so they went to the venue to Hacking with everyone. In addition to finding inspiration, you can also get to know many participating partners.\nDuring the two-day and one-night Hacking process, every participating team was very tense, and everyone was facing the computer screen very seriously. In order to allow every participating partner to participate in discussions and interactions in addition to Hacking. The organizers arranged quizzes (Quiz time) at 10:00, 14:00, 16:00, 20:00 and 22:00, and the winners of each Quiz had the opportunity to get very valuable related gifts. Such quizzes can not only allow each participating team to relax a little, but also attract more participants to interact with other teams at the venue. Making the whole event very lively and interesting.\nThe quiz forms are divided into the following types:\n\n\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" is a very interesting interactive game, and it is also a way for the hard-working participants in the audience to stretch their bodies. By the host raising their hand to play the game of guessing, you must win the host (if it's a tie, it's also considered eliminated) to advance. Only the last few people have the opportunity to come to the front to receive related gifts.\nThere are also other interesting small challenges:\nFind the different points in two pictures.\nGuess whose photo is in the picture.\nSome small history about LINE.\nThe design of these small activities, in addition to allowing the participating partners at the venue to have relevant interactions, also relieves the tension generated by the competition. Allowing each participant to face the problem more seriously.\n \nIn addition to the interesting quizzes, there are also treasure hunts. The organizers have hidden some small notes around the event venue and the restaurant. As long as you can find these small notes, you can also exchange for related gifts with the organizers at the end of each day. So you can see many participating teams, in addition to Hacking at the venue, you can also see them constantly searching for related \"treasures\" around the venue and the restaurant, the scene is very interesting.\n\nIn order to allow the participants to enjoy the interactive Quiz and Treasure Hunting more, the organizers have prepared a lot of gifts. I believe that every participant should have gained a lot.\n\nThere is always a day to announce the results of the fierce competition. Finally, congratulations to the team from Japan for winning the first prize. The second prize went to the students from the University of Tokyo, and the third prize went to the students from South Korea. These three teams are also happy to share, and they also shared on stage how to analyze the data, and shared the techniques to get high scores by understanding the data.\n\nOn the last day, a relaxing itinerary was arranged for all the participants. The staff arranged a Korean rail bike tour. The whole trip has a relaxing itinerary of nearly two hours. In addition to watching the beautiful railway scenery, there are also some tunnels with unique feelings. Every participant also relaxed and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of Korea.\n\nLunch was chosen with the famous Chuncheon chicken, and enjoyed the Korean Chuncheon flavored dishes in a flavorful Korean restaurant. Every participant told me that in the three-day itinerary, in addition to writing code Hacking, it was probably constantly eating. Whether it was the delicacies of NAVER Connect One, the snacks, or even the Chuncheon chicken on the last day. Every participant felt the organizers' intentions and the delicious food of Korea.\n\nThe event, which lasted for a whole month, finally selected thirty final teams from all over the world. The three-day intensive finals not only felt the enthusiasm of each participating team, but also felt everyone's focus and uncompromising pursuit of the best data model. Every team hopes that they can still come up with a better data model to solve the user's problems at the last moment, to seek the true meaning behind the data. I think this is also what AI-Rush wants every participant to get, and I look forward to the opportunity to meet every participating team again next time.\nJoin the \"LINE Developer Official Community\" official account now, and you can receive push notifications of first-hand Meetup events, or the latest news related to the developer program. ▼\n\"LINE Developer Official Community\" official account ID: @line_tw_dev\nLINE launched the \"LINE Developer Community Program\" in Taiwan at the beginning of this year, and will long-term invest manpower and resources to hold developer community gatherings, job fairs, developer conferences, etc., both internally and externally, online and offline, in Taiwan, and is expected to hold more than 30 events throughout the year.

NordVPN Privacy sits in that awkward middle ground - it's expensive as hell, but it actually works when you need it to.</p>\n\n<h3>The Meat: Where NordVPN Actually Matters</h3>\n\n<h4>1. The Double VPN Feature Is Legit (Unlike Most Competitors)</h4>\n\n<p>NordVPN's double VPN actually routes through two different servers in different countries. I tested this against ExpressVPN's \"double hop\" which just uses two servers in the same data center half the time. When I was researching a sensitive corporate espionage case last month, NordVPN's double VPN was the only one that didn't leak my real location when I deliberately tried to break it.</p>\n\n<h4>2. That Damn Map Interface Is Annoying AF</h4>\n\n<p>Let me rant about NordVPN's world map UI for a second. It looks cool in screenshots, but trying to click on a specific country when you're in a hurry is like playing darts blindfolded. The click targets are tiny, the map zooms weirdly, and half the time I accidentally connect to Portugal when I wanted Spain. For a tool that costs this much, you'd think they could implement a simple server list like every other competent VPN.</p>\n\n<p><strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Don't use the map. Just type the country name in the search bar. Saves 10 seconds every time, which adds up when you're switching servers multiple times daily.</p>\n\n<h4>3. RAM Limitations That Actually Matter</h4>\n\n<p>NordVPN Privacy runs on their proprietary NordLynx protocol (based on WireGuard), which means it's memory-efficient. I ran it on a 4GB RAM laptop for 72 hours straight while torrenting, and it didn't crash once. Meanwhile, ProtonVPN's Windows client ate 800MB of RAM just idling in the background.

Cofacts (real or fake LINE ID: <strong>@cofacts</strong>) originated from too many people forwarding uncertain news messages, causing unnecessary panic or the spread of false information. The operation process of Cofacts is as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Receive message in chatroom</li>\n<li>Forward to Cofacts</li>\n<li>Get auto-response</li>\n<li>Forward back to source chatroom</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The entire system is divided into two major platforms, one is for users to report and receive replies to edit reviews.

The following is an example mentioned by the speaker: By deploying the above EventController, as long as the user types \"Rathalos\" or \"火龍\" in the conversation box, the following text will be displayed, and it is very easy to add another monster, just add another similar YAML setting and deploy this EventController.

Users do not need to leave (opened through LIFF with 50% or 80% display) to allow users to quickly, effectively, and accurately fill out large forms, and can directly import the LINE user account when filling out.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Assisting users in sending special messages\n</h4>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, users (referring to non-Chatbots) cannot send Flex Messages, but through <code>liff.sendMessages()</code>, you can help users organize information into Flex Messages to share with the user's friends.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Private message delivery within the group\n</h4>\n\n<p>There are often people in the group who want to make individual private chat functions, and through LIFF, you can easily develop individual chat functions. Separate the chat into public and personal chats.</p>\n\n<p>Applications can be: Play board games in group chats, and the results are announced in the group, but the game process can be communicated through LIFF.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Third-party service binding\n</h4>\n\n<p>You can easily bind other services through LIFF, because the LIFF page contains user LINE information, which can easily bind related functions.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  QRCode scanning\n</h4>\n\n<p>You can use the scanning QRCode function of LIFF 2.0 to open the camera to scan the QRCode (Please note: iOS has suspended this function after 9.19.0, Android remains unchanged).</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  LIFF 1.0 and LIFF 2.0 mixed use\n</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxh0y08i8uhbd1k6cr8o1.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxh0y08i8uhbd1k6cr8o1.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"439\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, the speaker also shared a very useful table, which is how the mixed use of LIFF 1.0 and 2.0 will be?</p>\n\n<p>You can refer to this table:</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Table URL: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pfTUvDLSVFxLq4z%5C_NYq7xgHXEafeZICztw2mSuKPY-4/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pfTUvDLSVFxLq4z\\_NYq7xgHXEafeZICztw2mSuKPY-4/edit?usp=sharing</a>\n</h4>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Lightning Talks\n</h2>\n\n<p>After the three speakers, the next is to introduce the most attractive part of this community, which is the lightning talks.

Apesar das perguntas terem sido anuladas pela banca, “o fato gera dúvidas quanto à lisura da prova e à capacidade da banca”.\n\n\tAinda em relação à prova objetiva, a questão 2 da prova tipo B do cargo de soldado menciona o “artigo 266” da Constituição Federal, o qual não existe. Segundo Leila Maria, os candidatos afirmaram que não houve correção do erro em sala de aula.\n\n\tA promotora relatou, ainda, que os cadernos de questões de alguns candidatos ao cargo de soldado continham a inscrição na capa como “prova tipo A”, contudo, nas demais folhas estava assinalado “prova tipo B”. Para ela, isso “gerou, no momento, violação ao princípio da isonomia, por gerar insegurança e estresse nos candidatos que receberam o caderno de questões com este erro, já que não sabiam qual tipo de prova assinalar no cartão-resposta”.\n\n\tAlém disso, segundo o MP-GO, “posteriormente, tal erro causou dano na correção das provas destes candidatos, que tiveram suas provas corrigidas com o parâmetro de gabarito errado.

Porém, a Funrio registrou o boletim de ocorrência mais de um mês depois do ocorrido, quando foi questionada sobre tal documento.\n\n\tA promotora explicou na ação que, após recorrigir todas as provas dos candidatos aos cargos de soldado e cadete, no dia 22 de fevereiro foi divulgado o resultado preliminar para ambos os cargos, mas a nota foi divulgada apenas em relação a cada candidato, individualmente, na área do aluno, não havendo, assim, publicação de uma nova lista preliminar dos candidatos aprovados.\n\n\t“Ora, em um concurso já tão questionado, precário, duvidoso e repleto de falhas, a falta de divulgação de uma lista preliminar de candidatos aprovados nas provas objetivas e discursivas gerou mais dúvidas e questionamentos por parte dos candidatos, tendo em vista que a falta de transparência no certame, somada aos outros problemas aqui narrados, coloca em cheque a lisura e a credibilidade da prova”, asseverou a promotora.\n\tLeila Maria sustentou, ainda, que, além de problemas com a correção das provas e divulgação dos resultados, a Funrio cometeu erros, também, em relação aos gabaritos. No dia 13 de fevereiro, foram divulgadas as respostas para o cargo de soldado, contudo, com diversos erros. Somente após ser alertada sobre este fato pelos candidatos e pelo MP-GO, a fundação divulgou retificação para o cargo de soldado, no dia 21 de fevereiro.\n\tDa mesma forma, no dia 13 de fevereiro foi divulgado o gabarito final para o cargo de cadete, que também continha erros no sentido de não terem sido anuladas duas questões claramente nulas, dando brechas para que inúmeros candidatos entrassem com mandados de segurança, o que poderia trazer ainda mais prejuízo, atraso e insegurança ao concurso, segundo destacou a promotora.Cronograma e redes sociais\n\tOutra situação que afeta o andamento do concurso, segundo o MP-GO, foram cinco alterações no cronograma original. A primeira no dia 20 de setembro do ano passado (2ª Retificação do edital), a segunda no dia 1º de novembro de 2016 (5ª Retificação do edital), a terceira no dia 21 de fevereiro deste ano (8ª Retificação do Edital), a quarta no dia 6 de março passado (9ª Retificação do Edital) e a última no dia 7 de março (10ª Retificação do Edital).\n\tAinda segundo a promotora, alguns candidatos que fizeram as provas objetivas e discursivas divulgaram em redes sociais fotos do caderno de questões e do cartão-resposta, o que, para Leila Maria, mostra que não foi realizado controle efetivo para evitar que os candidatos acessassem o local de provas portando aparelhos eletrônicos.\n\n\t“Verifica-se que não ocorreu apenas um erro isolado nas provas para provimento dos cargos de soldado e cadete, mas sim uma sequência de erros que expõem o despreparo da Funrio e colocam sob questionamento a credibilidade e a lisura do concurso e a capacidade da fundação, que, ressalta-se, sequer passou por um processo licitatório para operacionalizar este certame”, ressaltou.

Para candidatos de alguns cursos, como medicina, será necessária uma prova prática.\n\n\tInscrições\n\tAs inscrições devem ser feitas por meio do site do Centro de Processos Seletivos (CEPS). O candidato deverá preencher a ficha de inscrição e obter o boleto bancário para o pagamento da taxa. O pagamento deve ser realizado até um dia antes do final do prazo de inscrição (10 de abril para mestres e 10 de maio para doutores).\n\n\tDepois de pagar a taxa, o candidato deve encaminhar, pessoalmente ou via Correios, a ficha de inscrição impressa e a cópia do comprovante de pagamento da inscrição ou documento de isenção emitido pelo CEPS. A entrega deve ser feita ao setor de protocolo da unidade responsável pelo concurso desejado.

          "content": "<p>For the last few years, most discussions about local small language models have focused on common themes: the lack of a need for an expensive GPU, lower power draw, privacy, independence from cloud vendors, etc. These are all valid advantages, and they were what initially drew me to explore slms as well. Like many others, I started by asking a simple question: can I get a language model to run on my laptop, without a NVIDIA GPU? The answer turned out to be yes, and that first step was satisfying.</p>\n\n<p>I've been using llms daily since ChatGPT was first released in 2022. So, the first thing I noticed from my local slm were its limitations. The novelty began to wear off and I drifted back to the online llms.</p>\n\n<p>But as I began trying different models - phi-3, qwen-2.5, gemma-3, I began to enjoy testing and benchmarking them - precisely because the limits are hit so easily - something you never encounter with a powerful online llm. Small language models are not just reduced versions of large ones. They are vastly different because of how the human is required to think in order to use them at all. You have to be very clear and very specific with them. </p>\n\n<p>Large language models have trained me and millions of other users into a particular relationship with AI. You can be vague with the model. You can improvise and bounce ideas off it. You can hint at an idea and let the model infer your intent, fill in gaps, and smooth over contradictions. That generosity is powerful, and you get used to it. It’s why systems like ChatGPT feel conversational, advisory, even oracle-like. The model absorbs ambiguity so the user doesn’t have to fully resolve it first.</p>\n\n<p>Small language models don’t do that. They can’t afford to.</p>\n\n<p>When you work with an slm, ambiguity isn’t absorbed — it’s exposed. If you don’t know what you want, the model's limitations will make that obvious. If your instructions are not specific, if they're vague or inconsistent, the output degrades immediately. At first, this feels like a limitation. In reality, it’s a demand - it's going to be on you to make the outcome successful. You have to decide what you mean before you ask.</p>\n\n<p>That demand changes everything, because it changes you.</p>\n\n<p>Using the slm effectively requires the user to externalize his or her intent, define boundaries, and specify constraints up front. You have to stop “playing” with the model and start operating it. I saw this begin to happen to me. The work shifted from the conversational exploration I'd become accustomed to from thousands of hours using llms, to something different - the slm required deliberate articulation from me. The model becomes less of an advisor and more of an instrument.</p>\n\n<p>The relatively small number of people seriously using slms are undergoing a change that isn't reflected in slm adoption statistics. These users are being forced into a different cognitive position. They are learning to separate thinking from execution, discovery from automation. That skill predates modern AI, and in many ways predates modern computing. It was gradually eroded by interfaces that grew more forgiving and more opaque. Perhaps this is the real pushback against the concept of 'vibe coding' - the user is too passive, too removed from the process. These small language models reintroduce friction — not as punishment, but as structure.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, this makes them more trustworthy in certain roles. They don’t 'pretend' to understand what you haven’t defined. They don’t improvise their way around weak specifications. They fail loudly and early, which is exactly what you want from a component in a system.</p>\n\n<p>The real revolution of small language models isn’t that they run locally, that they can ensure privacy or that they’re accessible without specialized hardware. These are all significant. But if you begin to use slms often enough, you discover that they offer something else that's very important - they force the human back into the loop as a thinking component. Large models are extraordinary tools for sense-making and articulation. Small models are extraordinary tools for precise execution — but only if the user is willing to do the work first.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the difference between llms and slms isn’t about scale. It’s about agency. By agency, I mean - where intention resides and who is responsible for meaning in the interaction.</p>\n\n<p>With large language models, a significant portion of agency is quietly transferred from the user to the system. You provide a loose prompt, and the model decides how to interpret it, what to emphasize, what to ignore, and often what the goal actually is. That isn’t a flaw; it’s a design choice. It’s what makes llms feel so helpful, conversational, and broadly accessible. But the cost of that helpfulness is that the model is exercising interpretive agency on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>And over time, users adapt to that. I did. We stop fully specifying our intent because we don’t have to. Maybe we don't know what we want and want the llm to tell us. And it will - the system will infer, improvise, and reconcile inconsistencies. Agency becomes shared and, in practice, blurred. The model is not just executing instructions; it is co-authoring the problem definition.</p>\n\n<p>Small language models just don’t support that kind of transfer. They leave agency where it started. If the task is unclear, it stays unclear. If the goal is under-specified, it isn’t realized. The model doesn’t step in as an interpretive partner; it waits for direction. The user becomes responsible for defining purpose, scope, and success conditions. Believe me, once you get used to it, you're glad. It's like waking up. </p>\n\n<p>There’s also a longer-term implication. When agency is outsourced, even partially, people begin to trust outputs without fully understanding how the conclusion was reached. This quickly becomes a habit, a way of working. But when agency is held by the user, trust has to be earned through clarity and reproducibility. These smaller models encourage the latter because they don’t mask weak thinking with their own fluency.</p>\n\n<p>I still use llms often - large models are willing to steer with you, or even for you and sometimes that's exactly what I want. Small models refuse. I no longer see that refusal as a limitation — it’s a mechanism that forces the human to stay in control.</p>\n\n<p>Ben Santora - January 2026</p>\n\n",

If the task is unclear, it stays unclear. If the goal is under-specified, it isn’t realized. The model doesn’t step in as an interpretive partner; it waits for direction. The user becomes responsible for defining purpose, scope, and success conditions. Believe me, once you get used to it, you're glad. It's like waking up. \nThere’s also a longer-term implication. When agency is outsourced, even partially, people begin to trust outputs without fully understanding how the conclusion was reached. This quickly becomes a habit, a way of working. But when agency is held by the user, trust has to be earned through clarity and reproducibility. These smaller models encourage the latter because they don’t mask weak thinking with their own fluency.\nI still use llms often - large models are willing to steer with you, or even for you and sometimes that's exactly what I want. Small models refuse. I no longer see that refusal as a limitation — it’s a mechanism that forces the human to stay in control.\nBen Santora - January 2026",

          "content": "<p>For the last few years, most discussions about local small language models have focused on common themes: the lack of a need for an expensive GPU, lower power draw, privacy, independence from cloud vendors, etc. These are all valid advantages, and they were what initially drew me to explore slms as well. Like many others, I started by asking a simple question: can I get a language model to run on my laptop, without a NVIDIA GPU? The answer turned out to be yes, and that first step was satisfying.</p>\n\n<p>I've been using llms daily since ChatGPT was first released in 2022. So, the first thing I noticed from my local slm were its limitations. The novelty began to wear off and I drifted back to the online llms.</p>\n\n<p>But as I began trying different models - phi-3, qwen-2.5, gemma-3, I began to enjoy testing and benchmarking them - precisely because the limits are hit so easily - something you never encounter with a powerful online llm. Small language models are not just reduced versions of large ones. They are vastly different because of how the human is required to think in order to use them at all. You have to be very clear and very specific with them. </p>\n\n<p>Large language models have trained me and millions of other users into a particular relationship with AI. You can be vague with the model. You can improvise and bounce ideas off it. You can hint at an idea and let the model infer your intent, fill in gaps, and smooth over contradictions. That generosity is powerful, and you get used to it. It’s why systems like ChatGPT feel conversational, advisory, even oracle-like. The model absorbs ambiguity so the user doesn’t have to fully resolve it first.</p>\n\n<p>Small language models don’t do that. They can’t afford to.</p>\n\n<p>When you work with an slm, ambiguity isn’t absorbed — it’s exposed. If you don’t know what you want, the model's limitations will make that obvious. If your instructions are not specific, if they're vague or inconsistent, the output degrades immediately. At first, this feels like a limitation. In reality, it’s a demand - it's going to be on you to make the outcome successful. You have to decide what you mean before you ask.</p>\n\n<p>That demand changes everything, because it changes you.</p>\n\n<p>Using the slm effectively requires the user to externalize his or her intent, define boundaries, and specify constraints up front. You have to stop “playing” with the model and start operating it. I saw this begin to happen to me. The work shifted from the conversational exploration I'd become accustomed to from thousands of hours using llms, to something different - the slm required deliberate articulation from me. The model becomes less of an advisor and more of an instrument.</p>\n\n<p>The relatively small number of people seriously using slms are undergoing a change that isn't reflected in slm adoption statistics. These users are being forced into a different cognitive position. They are learning to separate thinking from execution, discovery from automation. That skill predates modern AI, and in many ways predates modern computing. It was gradually eroded by interfaces that grew more forgiving and more opaque. Perhaps this is the real pushback against the concept of 'vibe coding' - the user is too passive, too removed from the process. These small language models reintroduce friction — not as punishment, but as structure.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, this makes them more trustworthy in certain roles. They don’t 'pretend' to understand what you haven’t defined. They don’t improvise their way around weak specifications. They fail loudly and early, which is exactly what you want from a component in a system.</p>\n\n<p>The real revolution of small language models isn’t that they run locally, that they can ensure privacy or that they’re accessible without specialized hardware. These are all significant. But if you begin to use slms often enough, you discover that they offer something else that's very important - they force the human back into the loop as a thinking component.

You provide a loose prompt, and the model decides how to interpret it, what to emphasize, what to ignore, and often what the goal actually is. That isn’t a flaw; it’s a design choice. It’s what makes llms feel so helpful, conversational, and broadly accessible. But the cost of that helpfulness is that the model is exercising interpretive agency on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>And over time, users adapt to that. I did. We stop fully specifying our intent because we don’t have to. Maybe we don't know what we want and want the llm to tell us.

          "title": "SLMs - A Very Different Form of AI",
          "content": "<p>For the last few years, most discussions about local small language models have focused on common themes: the lack of a need for an expensive GPU, lower power draw, privacy, independence from cloud vendors, etc. These are all valid advantages, and they were what initially drew me to explore slms as well. Like many others, I started by asking a simple question: can I get a language model to run on my laptop, without a NVIDIA GPU? The answer turned out to be yes, and that first step was satisfying.</p>\n\n<p>I've been using llms daily since ChatGPT was first released in 2022. So, the first thing I noticed from my local slm were its limitations. The novelty began to wear off and I drifted back to the online llms.</p>\n\n<p>But as I began trying different models - phi-3, qwen-2.5, gemma-3, I began to enjoy testing and benchmarking them - precisely because the limits are hit so easily - something you never encounter with a powerful online llm. Small language models are not just reduced versions of large ones. They are vastly different because of how the human is required to think in order to use them at all. You have to be very clear and very specific with them. </p>\n\n<p>Large language models have trained me and millions of other users into a particular relationship with AI. You can be vague with the model. You can improvise and bounce ideas off it. You can hint at an idea and let the model infer your intent, fill in gaps, and smooth over contradictions. That generosity is powerful, and you get used to it. It’s why systems like ChatGPT feel conversational, advisory, even oracle-like. The model absorbs ambiguity so the user doesn’t have to fully resolve it first.</p>\n\n<p>Small language models don’t do that. They can’t afford to.</p>\n\n<p>When you work with an slm, ambiguity isn’t absorbed — it’s exposed. If you don’t know what you want, the model's limitations will make that obvious. If your instructions are not specific, if they're vague or inconsistent, the output degrades immediately. At first, this feels like a limitation. In reality, it’s a demand - it's going to be on you to make the outcome successful. You have to decide what you mean before you ask.</p>\n\n<p>That demand changes everything, because it changes you.</p>\n\n<p>Using the slm effectively requires the user to externalize his or her intent, define boundaries, and specify constraints up front. You have to stop “playing” with the model and start operating it. I saw this begin to happen to me. The work shifted from the conversational exploration I'd become accustomed to from thousands of hours using llms, to something different - the slm required deliberate articulation from me. The model becomes less of an advisor and more of an instrument.</p>\n\n<p>The relatively small number of people seriously using slms are undergoing a change that isn't reflected in slm adoption statistics. These users are being forced into a different cognitive position. They are learning to separate thinking from execution, discovery from automation. That skill predates modern AI, and in many ways predates modern computing. It was gradually eroded by interfaces that grew more forgiving and more opaque. Perhaps this is the real pushback against the concept of 'vibe coding' - the user is too passive, too removed from the process. These small language models reintroduce friction — not as punishment, but as structure.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, this makes them more trustworthy in certain roles. They don’t 'pretend' to understand what you haven’t defined. They don’t improvise their way around weak specifications. They fail loudly and early, which is exactly what you want from a component in a system.</p>\n\n<p>The real revolution of small language models isn’t that they run locally, that they can ensure privacy or that they’re accessible without specialized hardware. These are all significant. But if you begin to use slms often enough, you discover that they offer something else that's very important - they force the human back into the loop as a thinking component. Large models are extraordinary tools for sense-making and articulation. Small models are extraordinary tools for precise execution — but only if the user is willing to do the work first.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the difference between llms and slms isn’t about scale. It’s about agency. By agency, I mean - where intention resides and who is responsible for meaning in the interaction.</p>\n\n<p>With large language models, a significant portion of agency is quietly transferred from the user to the system. You provide a loose prompt, and the model decides how to interpret it, what to emphasize, what to ignore, and often what the goal actually is. That isn’t a flaw; it’s a design choice. It’s what makes llms feel so helpful, conversational, and broadly accessible. But the cost of that helpfulness is that the model is exercising interpretive agency on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>And over time, users adapt to that. I did. We stop fully specifying our intent because we don’t have to. Maybe we don't know what we want and want the llm to tell us. And it will - the system will infer, improvise, and reconcile inconsistencies. Agency becomes shared and, in practice, blurred. The model is not just executing instructions; it is co-authoring the problem definition.</p>\n\n<p>Small language models just don’t support that kind of transfer. They leave agency where it started. If the task is unclear, it stays unclear. If the goal is under-specified, it isn’t realized. The model doesn’t step in as an interpretive partner; it waits for direction. The user becomes responsible for defining purpose, scope, and success conditions. Believe me, once you get used to it, you're glad. It's like waking up. </p>\n\n<p>There’s also a longer-term implication. When agency is outsourced, even partially, people begin to trust outputs without fully understanding how the conclusion was reached. This quickly becomes a habit, a way of working. But when agency is held by the user, trust has to be earned through clarity and reproducibility. These smaller models encourage the latter because they don’t mask weak thinking with their own fluency.</p>\n\n<p>I still use llms often - large models are willing to steer with you, or even for you and sometimes that's exactly what I want. Small models refuse. I no longer see that refusal as a limitation — it’s a mechanism that forces the human to stay in control.</p>\n\n<p>Ben Santora - January 2026</p>\n\n",

              "title": "SLMs - A Very Different Form of AI",
              "content": "<p>For the last few years, most discussions about local small language models have focused on common themes: the lack of a need for an expensive GPU, lower power draw, privacy, independence from cloud vendors, etc. These are all valid advantages, and they were what initially drew me to explore slms as well. Like many others, I started by asking a simple question: can I get a language model to run on my laptop, without a NVIDIA GPU? The answer turned out to be yes, and that first step was satisfying.</p>\n\n<p>I've been using llms daily since ChatGPT was first released in 2022. So, the first thing I noticed from my local slm were its limitations. The novelty began to wear off and I drifted back to the online llms.</p>\n\n<p>But as I began trying different models - phi-3, qwen-2.5, gemma-3, I began to enjoy testing and benchmarking them - precisely because the limits are hit so easily - something you never encounter with a powerful online llm. Small language models are not just reduced versions of large ones. They are vastly different because of how the human is required to think in order to use them at all. You have to be very clear and very specific with them. </p>\n\n<p>Large language models have trained me and millions of other users into a particular relationship with AI. You can be vague with the model. You can improvise and bounce ideas off it. You can hint at an idea and let the model infer your intent, fill in gaps, and smooth over contradictions. That generosity is powerful, and you get used to it. It’s why systems like ChatGPT feel conversational, advisory, even oracle-like. The model absorbs ambiguity so the user doesn’t have to fully resolve it first.</p>\n\n<p>Small language models don’t do that. They can’t afford to.</p>\n\n<p>When you work with an slm, ambiguity isn’t absorbed — it’s exposed. If you don’t know what you want, the model's limitations will make that obvious. If your instructions are not specific, if they're vague or inconsistent, the output degrades immediately. At first, this feels like a limitation. In reality, it’s a demand - it's going to be on you to make the outcome successful. You have to decide what you mean before you ask.</p>\n\n<p>That demand changes everything, because it changes you.</p>\n\n<p>Using the slm effectively requires the user to externalize his or her intent, define boundaries, and specify constraints up front. You have to stop “playing” with the model and start operating it. I saw this begin to happen to me. The work shifted from the conversational exploration I'd become accustomed to from thousands of hours using llms, to something different - the slm required deliberate articulation from me. The model becomes less of an advisor and more of an instrument.</p>\n\n<p>The relatively small number of people seriously using slms are undergoing a change that isn't reflected in slm adoption statistics. These users are being forced into a different cognitive position. They are learning to separate thinking from execution, discovery from automation. That skill predates modern AI, and in many ways predates modern computing. It was gradually eroded by interfaces that grew more forgiving and more opaque. Perhaps this is the real pushback against the concept of 'vibe coding' - the user is too passive, too removed from the process. These small language models reintroduce friction — not as punishment, but as structure.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, this makes them more trustworthy in certain roles. They don’t 'pretend' to understand what you haven’t defined. They don’t improvise their way around weak specifications. They fail loudly and early, which is exactly what you want from a component in a system.</p>\n\n<p>The real revolution of small language models isn’t that they run locally, that they can ensure privacy or that they’re accessible without specialized hardware. These are all significant. But if you begin to use slms often enough, you discover that they offer something else that's very important - they force the human back into the loop as a thinking component. Large models are extraordinary tools for sense-making and articulation. Small models are extraordinary tools for precise execution — but only if the user is willing to do the work first.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the difference between llms and slms isn’t about scale. It’s about agency. By agency, I mean - where intention resides and who is responsible for meaning in the interaction.</p>\n\n<p>With large language models, a significant portion of agency is quietly transferred from the user to the system. You provide a loose prompt, and the model decides how to interpret it, what to emphasize, what to ignore, and often what the goal actually is. That isn’t a flaw; it’s a design choice. It’s what makes llms feel so helpful, conversational, and broadly accessible. But the cost of that helpfulness is that the model is exercising interpretive agency on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>And over time, users adapt to that. I did. We stop fully specifying our intent because we don’t have to. Maybe we don't know what we want and want the llm to tell us. And it will - the system will infer, improvise, and reconcile inconsistencies. Agency becomes shared and, in practice, blurred. The model is not just executing instructions; it is co-authoring the problem definition.</p>\n\n<p>Small language models just don’t support that kind of transfer. They leave agency where it started. If the task is unclear, it stays unclear. If the goal is under-specified, it isn’t realized. The model doesn’t step in as an interpretive partner; it waits for direction. The user becomes responsible for defining purpose, scope, and success conditions. Believe me, once you get used to it, you're glad. It's like waking up. </p>\n\n<p>There’s also a longer-term implication. When agency is outsourced, even partially, people begin to trust outputs without fully understanding how the conclusion was reached. This quickly becomes a habit, a way of working. But when agency is held by the user, trust has to be earned through clarity and reproducibility. These smaller models encourage the latter because they don’t mask weak thinking with their own fluency.</p>\n\n<p>I still use llms often - large models are willing to steer with you, or even for you and sometimes that's exactly what I want. Small models refuse. I no longer see that refusal as a limitation — it’s a mechanism that forces the human to stay in control.</p>\n\n<p>Ben Santora - January 2026</p>\n\n",
